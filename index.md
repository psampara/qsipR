tagline: Statistical analysis package to identify isotope incorporating MAGs using the principles of quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP)
description: Statistical analysis to identify a stable isotope incorporating taxa obtained as metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Scaled absolute abundances are utilized which are obtained from relative abundance of MAGs and sequins (spike-ins) of known concentration over a range of coverages. Using absolute abundances and bootstrapping, atom fraction excess of MAGs is estimated, and thereby, incorporators of a stable isotope are identified. Please refer Hungate et al. (2015) (doi:10.1128/AEM.02280-15) for details on quantitative stable isotope probing. Additionally, the bouyant density plots for stable isotope incorporating MAGs will also be provided.

`qSIPmg` is a statistical analysis package to identify isotope incorporating MAGs using the principles of quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP).
Scaled absolute abundances are utilized which are obtained from relative abundance of MAGs and sequins (spike-ins) of known concentration over a range of coverages. 
Using absolute abundances and bootstrapping, atom fraction excess of MAGs is estimated, and thereby, incorporators of a stable isotope are identified. 
Please refer [Hungate et al. (2015)](doi:10.1128/AEM.02280-15) for details on quantitative stable isotope probing. 
Additionally, the bouyant density plots for stable isotope incorporating MAGs will also be provided.

A tutorial with an explanation of functions and mock outputs is provided. Also, an R markdown is provided for the complete workflow of qSIPmg. To download the R markdown file, right-click on the link and hit "save link as".

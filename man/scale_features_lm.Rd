\usage{
scale_features_lm(
  f_tibble,
  sequin_meta,
  seq_dilution,
  log_trans = TRUE,
  coe_of_variation = 10000,
  cook_filtering
)
}
\arguments{
\item{f_tibble}{Can be either of
(1) a tibble with first column "Feature" that contains bin IDs, and the rest of the columns represent samples with bins' pooled values. Every sequin is also listed s a feature.
(2) a tibble as outputted by the program "checkm coverage" from the tool CheckM (https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM). If this is the input format, the optional function, pooling_functions.R must be run. \code{pooling_functions.R} parses the checkM coverage output to provide a tibble as described in option 1. Please check \code{pooling_functions.R} for further details. Please check CheckM documentation (https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM) on the usage for "checkm coverage" program}

\item{sequin_meta}{tibble containing sequin names ("Feature column") and concentrations in attamoles/uL ("Concentration") column.}

\item{seq_dilution}{tibble with first column "Sample" with \strong{same sample names as in f_tibble}, and a second column "Dilution" showing ratio of sequins added to final sample volume (e.g. a value of 0.01 for a dilution of 1 volume sequin to 99 volumes sample)}

\item{log_trans}{Boolean (TRUE or FALSE), should coverages and sequin concentrations be log-scaled?}

\item{coe_of_variation}{Acceptable coefficient of variation for coverage and detection (eg. 20 - for 20 \% threshold of coefficient of variation). Coverages above the threshold value will be flagged in the plots.}

\item{cook_filtering}{Boolean (TRUE or FALSE), should data points be filtered based on Cook's distance metric. Cooks distance can be useful in detecting influential outliers in an ordinary least squareâ€™s regression model, which can negatively influence the model. A threshold of Cooks distance of 4/n (where n is the sample size) is chosen, and any data point with Cooks distance > 4/n is filtered out. It is typical to choose 4/n as the threshold in detecting the outliers in the data}

\value{
a list of tibbles containing
\itemize{
\item mag_tab: a tibble with first column "Feature" that contains bin (or contig IDs), and the rest of the columns represent samples with features' scaled abundances (attamoles/uL)
\item mag_det: a tibble with first column "Feature" that contains bin (or contig IDs),
\item plots: linear regression plots for scaling MAG coverage values to absolute abundance
\item scale_fac: a master tibble with all of the intermediate values in above calculations
}
}
\description{
Calculates global scaling factors for features (contigs or bins),based on linear regression of sequin coverage. Options include log-transformations of coverage, as well as filtering features based on limit of detection. This function must be called first, before the feature abundance table, feature detection table, and plots are retrieved.
